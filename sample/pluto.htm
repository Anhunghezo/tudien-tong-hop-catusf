<div align="center" title="Pluto is the most distant planet in our Solar-system."><img src="pluto.jpg" /></div>

<p ><b class="first" >T</b>he most distant ninth planet from the Sun, Pluto
appears as 1000 times fainter than its neighbor-planet <a href="neptune.htm">Neptune</a>. Although no
space probes, have actually done extensive research on the planet, many
astrophysicists have determined that Pluto rotates around its axis every 6 days
and 9 hours and has one insignificant moon named Charon.</p>

<p >Hypothetically, Pluto, may have emerged into a planetary formation from a
wayward satellite from the outer asteroid belt. Although, Pluto may actually not
be considered as the true final planet in our Solar System, currently, most
astronomers concur that Pluto should be the final significant planet within the
Solar System. Some however think that Pluto might not even be a real planet, but
a icelump which has accidently gotten the name 'planet'.</p>

<p >Further, as scientists begin to delve into the mysterious layers of Pluto,
they have begun to realize that Pluto may actually lack a true atmosphere. With
an average temperature below -230 degrees C, the gaseous state of the atmosphere
would freeze into a liquid or solid. Pluto itself may not even be a planet but a
big ice-lump!</p>

<p >Although much still needs to be found out about our final planet, Pluto still
has begun to send answers to questioning scientists. Pluto most surely will hold
a world of wonder within its core.</p>
