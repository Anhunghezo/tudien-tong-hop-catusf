      <p ><b class="first" >T</b>he Solar System can be divided into two planetary
      divisions. Divided based upon the distance from the Sun and physical <a href="" >characteristics</a>,
      the inner planets are termed terrestrial while the outer are respectively
      termed Jovian planets.</p>

      <p >Similar to the morphology of <a href="earth.htm">Earth</a>, the terrestrial planets include <a href="mercury.htm" >Mercury</a>,
      <a href="venus.htm"  >Venus</a>, <a href="earth.htm" >Earth</a>,
      <a href="moon.htm" >Moon</a> and <a href="mars.htm"  >Mars</a>.</p>

      <p >Characteristically, the inner planets share comparable sizes, densities,
      and structures. The composition of these worlds is rocky in nature with
      high boiling points. Originating from a concentration of hydrogen and
      helium gas and dust, the Solar System with terrestrial planets emerged.</p>

      <p >Further, the light compounds that formed the terrestrial planets soon
      vaporized by their close proximity to the Sun’s heat.</p>

      <p >Between the orbits of <a href="mars.htm"> Mars</a> and <a href="jupiter.htm"> Jupiter</a> float numerous celestial bodies:
      the asteroids.</p>

      <p >&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p ><b class="first" >C</b>oincidentally, the Jovian planets retained the
      lighter and colder gases within their compositions because of their
      distance.</p>
      
      <p >Moreover, the Jovian planets seem far more massive than the closer
      planets and are able to hold hydrogen, water, ammonia, and methane within
      their icy atmospheres.</p>
      
      <p >The Jovian planets are <a href="jupiter.htm"  >Jupiter</a>,
      <a href="saturn.htm" >Saturn</a>, <a href="uranus.htm" >Uranus</a>,
      <a href="neptune.htm">Neptune</a> and <a href="pluto.htm" >Pluto</a>.</p>
      
      <p >Outside <a href="pluto.htm"> Pluto's</a> orbit the comets reside. Every year we see them when a couple move close to the
