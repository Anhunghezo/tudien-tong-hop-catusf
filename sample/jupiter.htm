<p ><b class="first" >T</b>he fifth planet orbiting the sun at a distance 5.2
times the distance of Earth to the Sun, Jupiter forms a planetary system within
itself. Scientifically believed to have almost evolved into a star, Jupiter
still holds nuclear processes within, proving indications that Jupiter is a true
planet.</p>

<p >With a rotation speed of 90,000 km/hr, Jupiter rotates around its axis in
only 9 hours and 50 Earth minutes. Spinning at such an incredible pace, Jupiter
forms visible dark and light belts of clouds.</p>

<p >Underneath these clouds, exists no physical surface without a true solid
body-only liquid and breaks of solidity. The majority of Jupiter is composed of
liquid hydrogen and helium that form a swirling of the phases of matter at a
temperature of 30000 degrees Celcius at a pressure 30 million times that of
Earth.</p>

<p >An example of Jupiter's surface structure is the Great Red Spot. Existing for
at least 3 centuries, the Red Spot swirls as a gigantic oval in Jupiter's
southern hemisphere. Rotating within itself, the Great Red Spot, swirls with a
size greater than Earth every 12 days.</p>

<p >Phenomenally, Jupiter liquid core shrinks at a rate of 1mm per year.</p>

<p >Jupiter's own system of satellites, currently are numbered to contain 14.
Jupiter's personal solar system grew from dust particles that formed near the
Sun and others from the close asteroid belt, which got drawn to the giant planet
by gravity.</p>

<p >The inner five: Amalthea, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are bright stars
on Earth's horizon and are of the most value to space exploration.</p>

        than our Moon. Active volcanoes eject sulfurous fumes. As Io orbits
        Jupiter, it carries round with it a cloud of gas that simulates a
        primitive atmosphere.</td>
