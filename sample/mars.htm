<p><b class="first">T</b>he fourth planet from the Sun (227,940,000 km), Mars is
our solar systems Red Planet.</p>

<p>With recent explorations to the planet by the Mars Global Surveyor and the
Mars Pathfinder missions, a portal has been opened to a planet that could
possibly sustain primitive live Martians.</p>

<p>Temperatures on the Martian surface range widely from -135 degrees C to 27
degrees C during winter at the ice capped poles. The poles, containing bright
crystallized ice are composed of solid carbon dioxide or dry ice. Since,
missions to Mars have begun to transform into a scientific reality, the Martian
landscape had to be thoroughly examined for possible landing sites. Although a
possible ancient living ground, the Martian surface still holds expanses of
plains, ridges, and rift valleys.</p>

<p>Mars has a very thin atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide (95.3%), nitrogen
(2.7%), argon (1.6%) with traces of oxygen (0.15%) and water (0.03%).</p>

<p>The pressure on the surface is only one percent of that of <a href="earth.htm">Earth's</a>, but the
pressure varies greatly throughout the Martian landscape.</p>
Mars is closely orbited by two tiny satellites: Phobos and Deimos.
