<p ><b class="first" >T</b>hat it teems with life makes Earth a precious oddity
among the planets-although just how off, scientists cannot say. Certainly the
conditions that made life possible were sensitive to the planet's surface
temperature and therefore to its distance from the sun.</p>

<p >Abundant liquid water was critical to the planet's evolution. This water
moderated temperatures, eroded rocks, dissolved minerals and supported complex
chemical reactions, some of which yielded single-celled life close to four
billion years ago. Macroscopic animals started proliferating only around 600
million years ago, eons after photosynthesis enriched the atmosphere with oxygen.</p>

<p >Earth's large moon probably formed from the debris after a collision between
early Earth and another huge body. Because the moon and sun appear the same size
from Earth, or planet is the only one to witness the beauty of the sun's corona
during a total eclipse.</p>
