<p ><b class="first" >A</b> lthough most known planets have many moons or
satellites, the <a href="earth.htm">Earth</a>’s own Moon has been studied in the most detail with his
close proximity. The Moon is one-fourth the size of <a href="earth.htm"> Earth</a> and so the pull of
gravity on the lunar surface is approximately one-sixth of that on <a href="earth.htm">Earth</a>.</p>
<p >Recent expeditions, mainly by the satellite Clementine have led to the
discovery of a frozen ice formations at the poles of the Moon; however, the Moon
does not have free water nor an atmosphere, which causes a static state of
weather.</p>
<p >Revolving about the <a href="earth.htm"> Earth</a> approximately every 27 days, the Moon is 384,403 km
(238,857 mi).</p>
<p >While the origin of our companion Moon remains in debate, the most probably
theory of formation is the planetesimal impact. Stated within this theory is
that the Moon originally grew from the dust particles of an original nebulae
that formed the <a href="earth.htm"> Earth</a> and the rest of the Solar System.</p>
<p >As the <a href="earth.htm"> Earth</a> had begun its first rotations, the Moon spun off and because of
its smaller mass, it was grabbed by gravitation into eternal revolution about
the <a href="earth.htm">Earth</a>. This theory has been repeatedly been proven by the similarity between
the densities of the <a href="earth.htm">Earth</a>’s upper crust rocks and Moon rocks.</p>
<p >Still, with NASA budget cuts, missions to our closest neighbor have become
rare, leaving many Moon colonization plans to be canceled.</p>
