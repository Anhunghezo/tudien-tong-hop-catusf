<p ><b class="first" >T</b>he seventh planet from the Sun's corona, Uranus orbits
as a seemingly desolate blue-green disk on the Solar System's horizon.</p>
<p >Revolving about the Sun every 85 Earth years and 17 hours about its 98 degree
axis, Uranus probably had formed during a collision at the edges of the solar
system.</p>

<p >Further, strangely, Uranus rotates about its steep axis opposite to that of <a href="earth.htm" >Earth's</a>. As with most of the distant planets in the solar system, Uranus also
has a magnificent system of rings and moons that accompany its rotations.
Currently, the Voyager mission has discovered 15 moons and 11 rings that hover
about the blue planet.</p>
