<p ><b class="first" >N</b>eptune, fourth largest of the planets in the solar
system, and eighth major planet in order of increasing distance from the sun.
The mean distance of Neptune from the sun is 4.5 billion km, and its mean linear
diameter is approximately 49,400 km, or about 3.8 times that of the earth.</p>

<p >Its volume is about 72 times, its mass 17 times, and its mean density 0.31
that of the <a href="earth.htm">earth</a>. The period of rotation is about 16 hr, and the period of
revolution about the sun is 164.79 earth years. The average stellar magnitude of
the planet is 7.8, and it is therefore never visible to the naked eye, but it
can be observed in a small telescope as a small, round, greenish-blue disk
without definite surface markings.</p>

<p >The temperature of the surface of Neptune is about -218 degrees C , much like
<a href="uranus.htm">Uranus</a>, which is more than 1 billion miles closer to the sun. Scientists assume,
therefore, that Neptune must have some internal heat source. The atmosphere
consists mostly of hydrogen and helium, but the presence of up to three percent
methane gives the planet its striking blue color.</p>

<p >Eight known satellites orbit Neptune, two of which are observable from earth.
The largest and brightest is Triton, discovered in 1846, the same year Neptune
was first observed. Triton, with a diameter of 2705 km, is only slightly smaller
than earth's moon. It has a retrograde orbit-that is, opposite its primary's
direction of rotation-unlike any other major satellite in the solar system.
Despite its extreme coldness, Triton has a nitrogen atmosphere with some methane
and some form of haze, and it displays an active surface of geysers that spout
an unknown subsurface material.</p>

<p >Nereid, the second satellite, has a diameter of only about 320 km. Neptune is
also circled by five thin rings. Further, its magnetic field is tilted more than
50 degrees to the rotation axis.</p>
